# Sinapsis Technical PoC

## Intro:

Inside each folder you'll find a README file containing the instructions for the missions.
Each mission is structured as follows:
  - There is a goal (AKA: *what* you're building)
  - There are a set of requirements (AKA: constraints on *how* you build it)
  - There are a set grading guidelines. This is how we'll evaluate the PoC

## Instructions:

1. Fork this repo!
2. Pick one mission from the root folder and solve it
3. Complete as many missions as you want!
4. Send us your repo url to `jobs at sinapsis.co`

## What's next?

We'll contact you after reviewing your submission. Be ready for a show and tell describing your solution.

# **Have Fun! :-)**
