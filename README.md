# Sinapsis Technical PoC

## HOW TO USE

- Take a look at 'README.MD' inside 'thumbnail-generator-ui'

## Intro:

Inside each folder you'll find a README file containing the instructions for the missions.
Each mission is structured as follows:

- There is a goal (AKA: _what_ you're building)
- There are a set of requirements (AKA: constraints on _how_ you build it)
- There are a set grading guidelines. This is how we'll evaluate the PoC

## Instructions:

1. Fork this repo!
2. Pick one mission from the root folder and solve it
3. Complete as many missions as you want!
4. Send us your repo url to `jobs at sinapsis.co`

## What's next?

We'll contact you after reviewing your submission. Be ready for a show and tell describing your solution.

# **Have Fun! :-)**
